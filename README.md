### Defender Recommended Configuration Analzyer

The Defender Recommmended Configuration Analyzer (DRCA) is designed to compare the current configuration of a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installation and compare its settings to a recommended baseline.  It is a *troubleshooting* tool that just pulls important values from the configuration of the local client and compares it to the baseline.
