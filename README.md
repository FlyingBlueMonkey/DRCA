### Defender Recommended Configuration Analzyer  

The Defender Recommmended Configuration Analyzer (DRCA) is designed to import the current configuration of a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installation and compare its settings to a recommended baseline.  It is a *troubleshooting* tool and only *reports* on the differences, it does **not** make any changes to the configuration.
